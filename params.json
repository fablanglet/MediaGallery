View your pictures, watch your video.","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\n\r\nYou can view, play and delete your photos and video directly with this app with swipe,swipe and swipe in your Timeline. And you can not find the picture or the video you want in the middle of your notifications.\r\n\r\nIt's a beta version, but I publish it because I read a lot of comments on the glass-community forum that it is not easy to manage the picture on the timeline.\r\n\r\nI agree with all these comments, that's why I decided to develop this Glassware during my free-time.\r\n\r\nActual features :\r\n\r\nDisplay pictures/ videos\r\nPlay/Stop video\r\nDelete pictures/videos\r\nSwipe back/forward to navigate\r\nTap to show the menu","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
